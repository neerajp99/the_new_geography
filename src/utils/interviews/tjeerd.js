        Clearly such a statement gets one into a discussion about what Art is that is certainly hundreds if not thousands of years old. And it’ll get you quickly on very subjective slippery slopes.

Even if a set of algorithms can produce nice looking paintings, images or sculptures, that still could just mean the artist is the one who created those algorithms, even if the ‘art bot’ has built up internal workings that are a black box to the creator or anyone else, and it ends up doing things humans could never do so well (I think there are quite a lot of examples of that happening). The problem with art is of course that even human beings and animals oftentimes make lousy art.
This whole thing also remind me a bit of the Turing test btw. Or even more apt would possibly be the Chinese Room thought experiment by John Searle.

Substitute the question this thought experiment gets at, namely “Does the machine literally "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely simulating the ability to understand Chinese?” (see also strong AI vs Weak AI), with the question: “Did the AI just produce a pretty picture? Or did it make “Art”, AND is there true understanding of any meaning in this Art?”.
You then have two pretty fuzzy concepts packed into one (what constitutes Art vs just ‘stuff’? + what constitutes “understanding”?). Which is pretty tough.

I sent some more explanation of my initial provocation to Jared actually, because he said he did not agree with me and he pointed me at the work of his friend Mario Klingemann. As I had admitted also, I have not recently looked into this much and would not claim to have a well-informed opinion about current state of AI in terms of art creation.
But I DO know about art history (maybe more than most designers :).
So it might be worthwhile for you guys also to consider and ponder history a bit, be aware of the paths already taken, and not just go ooh and aah for any picture spit out by a set of algorithms. One cannot really just take any “Objet trouvé” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_object ) and call it Art, much like not just every can filled with human excrement is a work of Art. And I am not just being rude and distasteful here, but of course referring to the work of Piero Manzoni, Merde dártista. This is an important but also kind of old discussion and area of conceptual exploration, going back to Marchel Duchamp, Dada, etc. I bet even before that. But I do think it is also still very relevant. That work of Klingemann is totally awesome and without question Art in my opinion. That becomes clear instantly when you listen to him talking about the journey of how he works and what he is after.
He really uses the tech as a super complex set of tools and is on a journey of exploration and expression.  But, from my POV it is HIM doing it.
A very good friend of mine is a professional artist who works with living trees and plants.
So in my mind, the TOOL itself doesn’t make, nor does it NOT make something art.  But what you do with it and what you put into it is unique and important and that can make it Art.  Many artist of course have used as tools for expression living things in the world, for instance using active self-organizing natural processes which bring chaos or randomization, creating unpredictable but still structured patterns of “output”.  I think here for example of Theo Jansen, a famous Dutch artist building these huge mechanical moving constructs which become like living creatures as they are moving by wind and gravity.But note that in these examples the thought process behind it all, what these structures express and evoke, is incredibly intricate and deliberate. Plus it requires a ton of skill, knowledge of years, mastery of mechanics and manufacturing and forces, etc etc.  In fact Jared Ficklin himself is an artist, who shapes FIRE with music and sound waves, so you can actually SEE music!!   FIRE & MUSIC are his palette!  (he did a TED talk about this once).There is so much interesting work out there.  I just do not think it is EASY. It is never trivial or just a matter of zero effort.  If it is, usually it tends to be not that interesting.

It’s a complicated and super deep discussion, and of course I am being a bit blunt here and also mixing in other personal opinion about what the journey is of an artist and a designer, with my own preferences mixed in for human beings not forgetting or leaving behind the non-digital tools sets at their disposal. There is an amazing power in the analog physicality of the human body and its action-perception loop, and the interaction with the real world though that body together with the amazing tools we create. I love what people can do just with their hands and a piece of chalk, or a branch, or a piece of wood. Or with code. And I love the journey an artist makes, or anyone for that matter who is making ‘stuff’ you don’t have to be an official “artist”, from learning to master a pretty difficult skill or figuring out a non-trivial interplay or phenomena, whether it is playing a violin or painting with oil or sketching with a single simple pencil all the way to messing around with plants growing out of a shovel. We have had 2,6 million years of tool making and use. That we know of even. Think about how long that is! Most people don’t realize how long ago that first stone tool use was. Compare it to when we supposedly (as much as we can detect) started to control fire.  An ocean of time lies before that point in which tools were made.  I think that is awesome.

Now, I remember as a kid I had these class mates who claimed they could not draw at all (they could have if they wanted to learn, but they were mainly lazy and dismissive about it. Lazy about looking at the world (ask them to draw a bicycle on which they rode each day and they’d not even get close), and lousy at giving such an activity their attention, which always amazed me. And then when they saw a Picasso they’d still claim the right to say that any child could do that and it was just crap. They had no notion of the past works of Picasso and the huge production and years of honing his skills of drawing and painting (also very realistically) this guy went through. But they thought they could judge and say that work was stupid, and it would be easy to do it, (they thought erroneously).  I suspect they’d really appreciate a “painting” which was actually a printed digital photo of a sunflower with a Van Gogh filter applied. Or maybe a starry night painted by a an algorithm that had trained itself to rendering pixels in a way that made it look like paint applied by Vincent van Gogh. I know which of those three would be most interesting to me.

Now apart from making interesting ‘things’ with material, real-world and analog tools, there of course also is the aspect of deeper meaning and intent, of message, symbolism, semantics, deliberately placed emotions, all that lovely stuff which is hidden in works of art - placed there intentionally by the maker, or subconsciously, or even merely in the eye of the beholder at a later point in time.
This is all extremely subjective of course, and it also get into complex discussions about the value and merit of some modern art. Is a ‘message’ alone enough to make some ‘assembly’ a piece of art (modern art sometimes becomes a mere ‘cataloging’ of ‘things’ and then that exercise of the artist is deemed art purely by the effort). See again the Dada movement.  Or is beauty without any deliberate intention or a crafted message put there by a conscious being still considered Art?  If you have a set of trees in the wind drizzle paint on a canvas and it yields a beautiful composition, is that Art?  Many scenes of nature can evoke deep and meaningful emotions, projected expression, and powerful feelings in a human observer but is that “Art”? There several examples of purely random processes in nature which result in what appears to be very non-random but deliberate structures that have tremendous beauty and can be incredibly mesmerizing to behold.
But so is that just beauty created by mindless processes and in principle an accident, or at best a “craft” perhaps, thus NOT Art? Or is it Art? And then perhaps we would need a different word for the truly intentional kind? Or go half-way on that continuum, an elephant or a gorilla creating nice creative paintings, is that art or just messing around by an automaton, so output similar to what a non-sentient/unconscious AI algorithm would make?
If the AI cannot explain what journey it went on, and why it is doing what it is, it can certainly result in a beautiful painting, but I am not sure whether that makes it art. Maybe it does, and it really is the beholder who makes it so. Maybe I am being a bigot towards AI and software algorithms here and I am hurting its feelings.
As Designers we often are explaining that we are not artists. That what we do is a different activity of creation in essence. But our work may also at some point be taken over by AI.
I recently saw a team at Salesforce publish a set of explorations they did with design by algorithms.

I paint a bit in my spare time. And when I paint, I don’t just put paint on a canvas and try to get a realistic image of whatever it is I am painting. Or I just push paint around until something emerges that is beautiful. That would be impossible and also very uninteresting. I spend a ton of time just looking and thinking and experimenting, trying to get this giant set of semi-controllable variables, many of which I don’t understand and don’t know how to steer, to somehow come together and become an illusion of what I had in mind. Some mess that creates the convincing illusion for a viewer that they are seeing ‘a tree’ or ‘a distant rock’ or ‘a kooiker dog’ (a specific type of dog which was used in NL for hunting ducks), or a complete scene that makes them ‘feel’ something.
I don’t control or understand a lot of the variables and find it damn difficult to master. But I love it when a couple of blobs of paint allow a human mind to see a dog in them. It is both very deliberate and highly accidental somehow.
I am an amateur of course. I need Bob Ross’s happy little accidents regularly  :).  And not rarely I redo a piece several times, and it gets worse with every new attempt. It is really difficult to master.  But for me it is that process, involving the years of skill and knowledge and learning, and the coming together of all these factors in the physical real world and the non-physical thoughts in your head that ultimately make something into an interesting piece of “art”.  Again it does not HAVE to be traditional tool sets of course.  It can be code and algorithms, and it can be trees or plants as my friend uses.  Or fire. Or it can be friggin’ MS Paint for all I care.
But effort and an explorative journey must somehow be made by someone, I think at least.
