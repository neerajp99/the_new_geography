    questions: [
        "So if you remember the case of Brian Eno, one of the first enerative music artists who used their real magnetic tapes, created a sort of loop at the end to a random looping around so that every musical piece which is produced is unique just as the basic starting point.What would you classify generative music?",
        `What brings you to this generative music thing? Like do you hold a degree in music or then you made
a switch like into the music by learning programming or something. Do you already had a background in
programming?`,
`Whenever you are working on these generative music or algorithmic music, what is your first
approach when it comes to creating music to the means of an autonomous system and how often it
requires you to create new algorithms? Or do you like try to alter the previous algorithms?`,
`So before you start working on a project, Do you have an idea in your head like, OK, I'm going to work,
I'm going to create something like this, or you just dive into coding part and then you just proceed as the
flow of the code goes like, OK this music is going into this direction so I can make some changes and
make this type of music. So what do you do actually experiment with the particular instrument before
going on to? How do you frame your mind?`,
`As you mentioned, about like the data. Do you think, like, I have seen artists, I've seen one specific
project on Google Creative Labs, and it was created by three guys. I'm not sure who they were. So they
what they did is like they took a data source, like they took of audio sources from, I think, thousands of
different things, the dark sounds, saxophone sound, drum sounds, and they place it all over as of in the
form of our visualization. And once you have those visualization of music, it's generated and eventually
you can play them in the cities to create music. So, Do you think like in the future or in the coming years,
data will be one of the best resources for creating generative art, ingenuity, music. Yeah, like I mean, data
can be like anything. Yeah. As I mentioned, like, these guys took data as the sounds of different things,
ownself cause sounds of dogs, sounds of instruments and everything.`,
`With the increasing capability of A.I. to actually write lyrics, especially with the new GPT-3,
and there's a lot of innovation and lyrics. What do you think about that?`,
`what do you think that the name of the artist or musician matters more than the music itself?
The name and the fame which comes with it to say AI produced music. I admired it as much as a human
being produced?`,
`To come to the economic side of the interview and the question is, so would you say that a musical
piece is actually capable of being sold if it's being produced by artificial intelligence or even if it's
generative music? What would you say about the consumer oriented industry of the computer produced
music as such?`,

`So we will still be on the lookout for something?`,

`Do things like the viewership of this A.I. into the music industry is really able to
appreciate without understanding the technical effort behind that music piece? Like, do people care about
the hard work or the technicalities that you have provided on making that music? Or they just care about
the output, which is the final the music piece?`,

`You mentioned business point of local. Communities coming up, so something related to that. So what
do you think would be actually the capability of a democratizing and making music accessible to all and
that's making musicianship accessible to all? So we look at it in one way, the cost of actually producing
music might go down well with generative music. You don't need so many instruments. You have your
computer to work towards it. So what prospects would you see it being democratized? Maybe people
releasing ample amount of social opinion via their music or in the field of education to get interactive
majors, interactive human computer measures that would use this in the future, especially in this Post
corona world or then to the divide that stabilizes and how the people are confined to hold. And perhaps
such a thing could be used in something useful.`,

`I understand you discovered the passion for music, you got into the roots of musicianship through the
creation of algorithms, went deep into the technical framework of stuff. So what are the life lessons that
you learn out of it?`,

`Do you think this human computer collaboration that we are using these days is going to be more
common in the coming future? People are going to prefer this type of stuff over the normal, the music as
much as we like, such as you did in the previous question after this proposed covid. I do think this entire
human computer collaboration in the field of art and music is going to be more commonplace.`,

`I think the general vibe, the mood, societal constructs have a sort of part to play in that. So since you've
been in the field of generative art competition of? What do you think about this? AI virtual popstar to the
vehicle.`,

    answers: [
`It would be like I always have a bit issues with the classification because for me, like the center point of
generative music, a process in the end. But then there is also that the term of like procedure and music or
process music in itself. But for me, but for me, I really like the maybe the maybe a key difference might be
then that for the generative music. Like process music for me, then it's more like conceptual art, maybe
where the process is very much into focus, also aesthetics and all that, you would maybe perceive
something and then you would not like get the joy out of it from maybe from the acoustic sensations. But
as you because you understand the process and the process by itself, it's like a fascinating thing. But still
also for agentive music and for my own work, like I'm usually very like I start with the process is usually
that. Then that's also the thing that is interesting for me. Like, it's not that I have usually not a certain
sound in mind that I want to create with the process, even though, of course, like there is some
imagination of how it could be. But it's more a question for me. How will the process sound? Yeah and so
it's like more experiment, actually, for myself and then like bringing it to an audience system, more like
that, people can participate also in the same experiment. And I think that something interesting came out.`,
`So like in my teenage years, I was playing the saxophone. So this is basically where my musical career
started. And I was also like very like, let's call obsessed with computers. So I was like just sitting in front
of the computer a lot. My older brother was also programming, so I was just observing it and like trying to
learn to program myself already in my teenage years. So these were kind of like the two topics when I
was still in school, like computers and of course, also gaming and programming on the one side, then
also playing the saxophone. And then I studied in the end like a course and constantly it's called like it's
called music. Listen to music informatics. So like literally translated musicology and music informatics or
computer music or music, computer sciences or something like this where yeah. There I basically started
to engage more with like actually Dell. I felt like connected to like ways and did less and less of traditional
like saxophone playing to me like I, I could. I haven't touched it for years unfortunately, which is also a bit
sad. But I really found like this new world of the you have generative music and of algorithmic music and
also, you know, like experiencing more experimental music and more conceptual music and descends,
which really sparked my interest in me.`,
`I guess like I've often actually the way I go about with my like music ,alternative music, it's not that it's fully
autonomous because I do a lot of this life coding, which is more a dialogue actually, like, of course, to the
computer is executing an algorithm. And so it is autonomous. But I'm still like observing and then
changing the algorithms, you know. So it's let me think about it. I mean, I also did like fully autonomous
systems or installations and everything. And also then it's usually that there is some subtopic either or
some process that I'm that I'm interested in. So, for example, like a like a maybe a bit like example I had
and I'm like interested in, like collecting mushrooms in the forests. And so I really got, like, also a bit
obsessed with taking pictures of mushrooms and Then at some point, I was also looking at all the patents
and everything, and so I was also like from a mile from a hobby perspective. I was stunned, like looking at
patents. And then I was thinking, how could I turn that again into music? And then I was writing programs.
Yes, too. I'd like to turn to the images of the patterns into music. So there was like really a personal,
again, like personal interest. And I'm like a curiosity about pattern. And then like a technical step off, like,
oh, yeah, I can have I have an idea how to turn like images into like music or Senechal events. And then
like I put it in. But other works, for example, they would be more about the process that I observed and
like in nature, and then I want to recreate it or something like that. But it's usually like it's really a musical,
like rallied an inspiration from a musical around that. I hear something and I want to recreate it. It's more
that I observed the environment and I want to like, let music grow out of it or sound grow out of it in some
way.`,
`That's like I guess like I start, I start like pretty early of course. I think, I think about things first of all. But
just like again both like more like engineering questions about, you know, like if I want to achieve like a
certain thing then how do I structure my program? But then also, of course, like, you know, like how do I
imagine the data could be put in a way that it's also a statically pleasing. But then rather quickly I start
prototyping and then so I start, you know, like taking data and taking the process like writing some code,
putting already some, you know, like some maybe naïf like, like ideas of like putting it into sound and
something that and then often things develop from there. Interestingly, like often when I imagine done
something, you know, I have a certain goal and then I don't because like when you program, you always
make mistakes and things actually work differently in the end. But this is often also a source of inspiration
because it is actually interesting that when you're working with process and algorithms. That's you know,
things happen that you did not imagine before, and so you could also see it as this like opportunity to
create things that were outside of your creativity and then you can include them like reason about them,
just like. Yeah, like take them on them, like they become part of your repertoire. And of course, there
were happy accidents, but still, they're often the most interesting parts of it, I guess.`,
`I mean, without data like anyway's generative artist, like not really possible, I mean, you know, like that
the question is maybe more if like techniques were like vast amounts of data, at least for me, the question
is, if these techniques were a vast amount of data is like. You know, sort of in a sense like kind of like
through machine listening algorithms, kind of like classified and clustered, if this will, for example, like

then either, again, synthesizing from that or just, you know, aiding composers or some designers by
giving them a different view on all the data, on all the material, if this will like change things.
And I guess this is like very much anyway. So already the case when you look at also how music
production has changed, that you now have all these big sample libraries which are, you know, like sorted
by moods and by, you know, just like this, the vastness of all of it. It's already like not necessarily only four
percent of music, but a changed like music making, especially like for functional music, like for
Advertising.com movie, like very, very drastically, but advantage out of sight. Of course, there's like new
opportunities now with, you know, with increase of like storage and of computation and also new
algorithms and machine listening in general, like when in the 70s you did not have the opportunity yet to
do like big like data analysis and re synthesize something out of that. It was more about, oh yeah, I come
up with some algorithm that I formulated code and then I run it and then it will create a new world. And it
was less about, you know, that I write an algorithm that will basically observe like artifacts of the world
and then synthesize something new like.`,
`Interesting as an artistic statement, maybe, you know, like, um, also interesting that it's not perfect yet.
And I guess the clitoris in the end are the interesting parts. You know, when the like, generally with art,
also all the work that the you know, the work with guns and everything like it becomes for me, always
interesting when it's uncanny or when it's when, you know, like when half of the face is melting off or
something like this. Like again, like the for me the interesting parts are done when the system fails and
shows itself. And then something interesting can be seen there, like when, when the I would become so
good that basically it's indistinguishable like again from like a human right there. Then the question is
really if if it will bring something new also for the ones who conceive it or is it just is it just like
Indistinguishable and then probably I would also like to think that making music and writing poetry and
everything, it's like it's after all the value in there is also that it is like a human activity. So like where is
where is really the value then on like doing it with an eye, especially at Stata. So much like already out
there, you know, like it's more, it's more, it's more an issue actually that there is too much music to listen
to, too many books to read. So like. The you know, like the attention of people is actually becoming more
and more a valuable resource when there is too many things to actually perceive and experience. So,
Yes, I don't I don't I'm not I'm not like that's that interested in that, I guess.`,
`You know, like for many, for many, for many music it's anyway, it's like pop music, for example, the
personality and all the media around it matters to such a high degree for the perception of the music. That
it's even hard to reason about this probably really. If one can see music without the person that created it,
you know, like in the real world, it's how people interact with music. Of course, one can have like lab
experiments where you just play music, like blindfolded without telling people. And but this is not really
how music is perceived. The person who is producing the music, that is very much like, yeah, because,
you know, because you do you like you rarely really disconnect the music from the person. Like in music
perception, at least if you really get into the music. Otherwise, of course, you know, if it's like music that is
just in the background somewhere, but then it's also not that you, like, pay very close attention to it, I
guess.`,

`Yes. Huh. I mean, this is a good question. I mean, there's there is already like. How was he called the
David Cope, I guess? Let me quickly to David Cope, the composer who also like. Yeah, David Cope also
like is selling like music for many years that is also autonomously generated. He did some experiments on
that. I mean, for the like really like but you know, like it's also experimental music. So the question is also
if it's like really like so much like an economic like thing anyways. Like, I guess, yeah, I guess, I guess I
guess you know, like if you look where the money is, the music, then it will become more difficult now
because as I said, that it's so much linked to two personalities and, you know, to real things. Of course,
there might be also like that, OK, there is just this novelty and it's a gimmick. And then there will be this
one like I artists that will become super PAC. But then I don't think that there will be like a like a big
market for it, like in music that you would buy. And I think there is a big market in like the function music,
you know, like music where you do like music, advertising, music for, for film, music for all of this, you
know, where, where there's like basically like people don't really buy the music. But if the music is needed
for, like, creating some other experience and then the music is anyway small in the background, but I
guess they're like tools will evolve and people like are working on things and this will change the market

at least, you know, like many people who did Dundee's Productions, when I can do like something that is
like really similar for artists, like for this function, then also they will maybe need to rethink some of what.
And yet there is I guess there is a big market there and I think it just might just broaden out like the music
is already being used in live music, mixing, dee-jaying. So it might enter into different categories of usage.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, there is, you know, like in a sense, if you think about, like mixing and
everything like music, racialists anywhere is already like there is the system.So if you got on YouTube
and you listen to a song, then it's a system bit give bring you the next song and the same with other music
services.`,

`Yes. Something, you know, like, ah, just being just having a certain, like sensibility, really. This is like, you
know, and this is what people are really looking for in arts and in photography and in music, that there is
some somebody like feels like has a sensibility for a thing and then creates and transports and you know,
like some like I like some people might think that like or like it's a bit too utopian really too.
Like, like think like if I would be a sensible assassin it would be anyways like hard to really like reason that
they are different than us, you know. So we maybe don't need to talk about ideas and then we should talk

about like, like organic life and silicon life or something like this, I don't know. But it's also a bit like. Spun
around.`,

`I guess like that this is also like already like the questions, if it's really communicated.
As not always, it is communicated with what is behind the what is the behind the thing, and then I guess
there is like just multiple reactions to things also that that I had as some are like saying, oh, yeah, this is
like interesting craft or it's just interesting what I did not know that it is possible at all, maybe also. Others
might be like also scared about it in a sense, because I guess I salzhauer always about a certain
narrative, not when you talk about A.I. people will also imagined the thing that would replace humans, for
example, and people would be scared about that. But this is like a kind of important for it.
I really I guess because when you when you mention AI, then people most people, of course, some will
just think about. Oh yeah. Like formulas and everything. But other most other people will also think about
actually science fiction. So, you know, like along with a term that is a narrative or like a like some. Yeah,
like a narrative, basically.`,

`I guess like, you know, like that terrorists. Again, the question of what one really perceives as making
music like us, making music like pushing a button and then you have music or is making music really, you
know, like applying some like, like is it more like actually a craft. So you know, also like if like what is
actually the thing one does really want to do. Like for me it would be, you know, I like to write the
algorithms that it makes, but it's also because, you know, it's what I like to do, but I really like it. But, you
know, I would not like go around and download some arguments of other people and, you know, I would
read them and try to understand them, but I would not just listen to the things really and with, you know,
what I told. I also just don't think that it's really on the same level as really making music when you're
using some system that you did not create yourself. But like on the democratization of everything, I guess
open source is, of course, like more the more the drive here, but also generally like also software like
GarageBand, even though, of course, it's unique, like a Mac, and that's like a lot of money. But still it's,
you know, like it puts like a studio that's like what's super expensive, just some like some years ago
basically for free on your computer that you got.
So I guess I guess the tools for creating electronic music are anyways already very, very affordable.
And then of course, like what iPod might do is that you need less skill. And this is, of course, also in a
sense like an apple smart people to make music, like to create music. But it does not enable them maybe
more to actually be able to make music. You know, it doesn't I don't know if it necessarily will teach you
skills. It will just enable you to produce something. Like , you know, like it's like if you buy frozen pizza, it's

that it will it will feed you and you will have a pizza experience, but it doesn't teach you how to like pizza
from scratch and actually of learning lies and actually getting deep into it. Like doing it in the first place.
And when the technology is like really, you know, like it's really like basic basically I'm doing the things for
you and then you will not really learn it. I mean of course this also happens in a sense, you know, when
you're dealing more with analog synthesizers and everything than maybe you had better soldiering skills
for somebody who is not only using the computer, but still there's like, you know, and all the stuff like that.
Big difference between like just letting some you know, I'm using a system that basically takes away all
the difficult decisions from you.`,

`If I got I guess, like, I mean, life lessons, I mean, first of all. Like, there is a very good, like byproduct of
like investing a lot of time and making music in that way that I like, I mean, I'm just also a programmer.
So like my most of my money, I don't earn from, like, doing music or something like this, but just, you
know, programming, it's still like, you know, it's like it's it's like if I would like to escape first, I would be also
good with a hammer. So if I like, I can also hammer other things more or less so like less and less of a life
lesson. But there is like a there is a big practicality, of course, of like being able to like being a
programmer and like in the real life, that it's a money that's dimensionality of. Yeah if you if it's a craft that
this can be applied to other fields as well. I am generally I guess like, like working so much with
prosthetics make me appreciate that the environments are also more like I'm more carefully like looking at
things and thinking about things like how did they you know, like when I walk on a beach and then I see
like patterns in the sand and I'm looking at the water, just trying to understand everything how like shapes
are created and how, you know, how this all comes together. So it's also outside of like using the
computer for doing things that's a different way and how to perceive the world, which is, of course, like a
nice thing in the end, because it can be like very simple things can give me great joy. Let's call it like this,
I said.`,

`More commonplace. I would I would almost argue that it's anyway so already, even before covid and
everything, that it was quite, quite commonplace. And, you know, like I also just think that it's you can
even roll it back, that it's like the relationship between human and tool, that it's like since we have tools
like it's like changeless things very dramatically. You know, when we had a hammer, we built different
things. When we had steel we had built different things. We did different things. We felt different about
things. I don't think like if the question was also if after covid, when we virtualize so many things, if then
this will stay there for the music, I am not fully sure because of course there is like people doing network
music, which is also very much about like, you know, like exploring the properties of networks and
sometimes even seeing a network as far as like it's a unique space.So like you will do like different music
and a network than you would do otherwise. I guess most music did not benefit from from it, really. And
people are also not, like most people are, dissatisfied with the situation that like musicians that are not
dissatisfied with the situation, especially after one did the second like other extremely concert. And it's like
not the same thing in a sense. But of course, there will be new things coming and new things will also be
explored anyways, like I guess like, you know, 20 years ago one did not foresee how things are
nowadays. So like in 20 years, it will also be drastically different, probably as well. And like and, you
know, like also like art and music. There is also always a counter note. There is also like if something if
there is a status quo, then music and art will also anyway's like say oh now I had enough of this and then
they will do something else anyways. You know, they go through phases. Like maybe, maybe then it will
become very fashionable that music will be very upclose and that you will have a lot of physical contact
just because we couldn't have any physical contact anymore. Like who knows really. But probably when,
you know, when that is like when something gets too mainstream or two to established music and art will
like say, oh, let's do something else.`,

`Yeah, yes. I mean, like when I when I first like I kind of like I did not like really I personally hated that. Is it
like let me think about like I was first impressed like the first time I saw her like on the internet was with
one of these projects, you know, like this production on like a half transparent screen so that she appears
kind of as being a hologram on the screen. And now I know now I've also seen that that they're doing like
augmented reality like that, you know, like in a television broadcast, like projecting the 3D model S, like
some augmented reality on the stage. I find it kind of like very I find it interesting, like it's not music that I
would listen to, even though this Robotech the robotic voices like half a certain appeal to me. And you
know, as I understand it also, like, you know, like I'm not really into anime and everything like this. But I
understand that for many people, this is like a very, you know, very dear to their hearts and. You know, I
would also see it made probably in this context that there are gifts, it is a manifestation also of something
that they anyways like feel for a long time already watching. And they may all like reading, reading manga
or something like this. Technically, the vocalised software is interesting, though. But there will be much
more further like developments on that on that as well, like the like, you know, speech synthesis and
everything. It is constantly interesting that it exists like musically, like it's not it's not really mine, but it is it
is fascinating. It is I must say also that it has an appeal, even more interesting to observe the audience
like cheering, cheering to me like some virtual being, but just not able to find that, like communicating
basically with with a like, you know, they're communicating like I have a plan, but like that she's not there.
She doesn't hear it. This is like interesting. And people fall in love with like virtual characters and with
artificial intelligence, like, you know, like it's real feelings they have.`
