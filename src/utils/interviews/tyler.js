    questions: [
      `Has AI/autonomous systems ever surprised you to the core? Can you give one instance of when you were thoroughly shell shocked by the final output?`,
      `Do you think that the viewership of AI art is really able to appreciate without understanding the technical effort behind the piece?`
    ]

  {
    answers: [
      `There have been times when the final output set produced by autonomous systems and AI
have taken the artists also by deep surprise.`,

      `Most of my collectors have some
sort of tech/science related background. The change in the kind of collectors of AI Art is also in
one sense showing hints of radicalization occurring within the AI art market.`
