    about:
      "Mario Klingemann is an award-winning artist and skeptic with a curious mind, whose preferred tools are neural networks, code and algorithms. He recently made headlines with the sale of his piece Memories of Passersby I, which was one of the first AI artworks bought in a traditional auction house (featured below). The art of that piece, he explains, is the code and system itself, rather than its continually evolving output on two screens - representing an important historical and conceptual landmark in the history of the art market.

    questions: [
      "It is often said that art is a reflection of one’s own life. Would you say the same about your artworks? Does the AI knowledge base reflect upon yourself as a person as well?",
      "Is AI Art capable of being ‘sold’? How is the consumer oriented industry? What are the marketing strategies you use to sell/propagate AI-art because I feel the knowledge about the efforts that go into AI art is still limited.",
      "How long does it take for you to produce a piece of AI-Art? A minimum or maximum of sorts, Mario? ",
      "I noticed a sort of pattern in your artworks - A consistency of portraits as an art form. How did you come close to this style? Is this something deliberate?",
      "Is data the best resource for creating/generating AI art? ",
      "What’s your approach when it comes to creating artworks through the means of AI/autonomous systems? How often it is required to create new algorithms or alter the existing ones.",
      "How do you see machine intelligence for the creation of art forms? Is it just the machine intelligence or sound, light, and infrastructure that is a crucial part of creating art?",
      "Does Artificial Intelligence open doors to more opportunities in the field of art than what artists think of normally?",
      "Does it break the line between reality and fiction?",
      "Are you worried that with the community of AI artists to be growing at a fast pace, there might come a time when anyone could be an AI artist like what has happened with graphic designers over the years? Would this according to you lead to less ‘exclusivity’ in the AI-Art industry?  ",
      "Do you think that the viewership of AI art is really able to appreciate without understanding the technical effort behind the piece? ",
      "Do you as an artist have a final art sketch/idea ready in mind or it comes along the way when you start writing the code? Do you believe in creating sample models before the final piece?",
      "Has AI/autonomous systems ever surprised you to the core? Can you give one instance of when you were thoroughly shell shocked by the final output?",
      "Where do you think AI and Art is going to be used in the future? Where do you think it is going to be commonplace to see AI art being used? ",
      "What do you think about the capability of AI in democratising and making art more accessible to all? Also what strategies do you think people should use to increase the amount of knowledge around AI-Art?",
      "What inspires you to create artworks/models that use AI/autonomous systems?"

    answers: [
      "Working with AI is always a feedback loop in which you interact with a model and then base your next input or action on the output you get from it. The actions that you take or the ways you interpret the output is absolutely dependent on your personality, life experience, knowledge and your type of personality. So yes I would say that it constantly reflects upon myself. The themes and methods I choose to explore and which ones I avoid among all the possible ones is what makes my work with AI as personal as a traditional artist's choice of materials or subjects and constitutes my 'signature style'",
      "Yes it is. But with the broader art market being very conservative and playing it 'safe' (by being mostly interested in traditional painting and sculpture) it is surely a niché for the more risk-taking collectors. I am not really someone who thinks about marketing strategies and as such I am also quite displeased with certain 'bullshit' techniques that some more market-savy players in this market employ. With that I mean the making-up of fantasy stories about magical AI that might sound good but have no base in reality. ",
      "I see my work as a continuous process that started about 30 years ago. The works that I make are a snapshot of the current level I have reached in my explorations and as such it is often hard to say when the work on a piece has actually started since it is always a combination of tools, techniques and models that I might have created long before. But I would say a typical timeframe for an installation is between 2 and 4 months. With prints or videos the process is different, in that case it might have taken me several weeks to engineer and train a particular model, but once I have it it can generate hundreds of possible works in an hour. Of course I have then still to go through them and only select those that I find worthy ",
      "I would say one of the hopefully recognisable features in my art is my obsession about details and organic looking textures. That and maybe my tendency to play with human perception. I don't know if you can call that deliberate, but is what I want to see and what I have to do. ",
      "Data is the only source. But I guess we mean different things by that. Even if you have an untrained model it's internal weights which are responsible for the output it generates is already 'data'. You cannot generate something from nothing. Any input you feed to the model is data, even if it is a random number. But of course there are forms of data that are closer to what we perceive as meaningful or in which we recognize something: images, human written texts or music and using this data as a starting point will bring you to 'interesting' places in space of all that is possible quicker and you will have more time to explore those areas in detail instead of having to find a signal in the noise.",
      "I have a growing arsenal of models and algorithms that I can use like LEGO bricks - I can plug them together to either accomplish a certain goal or to find a new surprising outcome. I am also constantly observing the latest developments in this field by following scientists and researchers and when they publish something new I start experimenting with it to see if it can take me to new areas or allows me to improve my results. Beyond that I always try to find ways how to break these models or use them in a way that was not in the intention of the maker as another means of getting results that are away from the default or normal. This process happens constantly. I like challenges and just reusing established processes that are guaranteed to work is not satisfying to me.",
      "I see the machine as a very smart generator of controlled randomness. It acts as a catalyst for ideas and inspiration but it does need a human to make the choices what is art and what is not. Whilst it might appear that active part in this becomes smaller and smaller I just see AI like a lever that allows us to move a huge mass by excerting very little force. But we have to decide where to place the lever and when to pull it.",
      "It allows you to explore more possibilities in a shorter amount of time. And I think that seeing more possible routes which to take can result in more interesting outcomes. If we are only relying on our own imagination we might be tempted to follow the beaten path.",
      "Working with a lot of machine generated text I noticed that I start looking at any written text with a sort of skepticism since all of them start feeling like they could just be fiction. Working with AI surely makes me question more what it is that we perceive as our  reality.",
      "Anyone can claim to be an AI artist already just like anyone can say that they are an artist. Art is a belief system and success as an artist is defined by how many believers beyond yourself you can find that believe in you. What the advances in technology will do is to add more noise to this process and they make it harder to get recognized in the mass. At the same time the mechanisms how and where to get attention are in constant change, too so rules that were working in the 20th century to produce superstars cannot be applied to our times as easily anymore. I have my doubts that we will get as many celebrity artists in the future as we still have now, it will be rather a lot more artists that have their comparatively smaller circle of admirers. But  human psychology probably still wants a few of them around.",
      " Probably not. But again I think this is not much different to how traditional art is appreciated by the majority of people. A good work should be possible to be experienced without knowing what is behind it, but the more we know about it the more we are able to get from it. So my hope is of course that the next generation of art audiences that grew up with technology will also develop a deeper understanding than just admiring the pixels on the screen.",
      "Sometimes an idea comes before the work, sometimes the idea emerges out of experimentation. I do not really have a recipe for it. There is always a process of prototyping that comes before the final work, just like a sketch comes before the painting.",
      "The problem with surprises is that the more experienced you get in a field the less surprises you get. So I learned to curb my expectations and the surprises are more on a smaller level like an unexpected detail or composition. The latest big surprise was OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It is really able to surpass one's expectations with the texts it is able to generate.",
      "Intelligent assistants will become part of our daily lifes just like mobile phones are already. These assistants will be like genies in a bottle that can make certain wishes come true. And if it is images, movies, music or text that you want they will be able to create a unique and very personal piece for you based on your personality and requests. So in the long run maybe we don't need artists anymore when everyone can feel like they have become artists themselves. For a while we will still need people who can build those tools that allow people to have that experience.",
      "Unfortunately it is inevitable. I say unfortunate since whilst I believe that it is wonderful that everyone has access to these tools now and adds more voices and different perspectives to art,  it also takes away some of the magic and makes it less of a special experience. It is like when you know how a conjurer's trick works - you can't enjoy it as deeply anymore. And I think one part of art is a feeling of fascination seeing something that you could not have done yourself which goes away when everyone believea that they can.",
      "I am not sure if I am driven by inspiration. I am rather driven by the urge to escape the normal. I look at the world and see what most people like and I try to get away from that. The problem is that once you have found a place that is not as crowded normality keeps creeping up on you and you have to move on. You saw that happening with what is now called AI art and which did not have a name yet when I and a few others started exploring it. Fortunately I believe that within this field there are still plenty of hideaways that are harder to get to and will require some effort that goes beyond just a mouse-click, so might be able to enjoy some solitude there for a moment."
