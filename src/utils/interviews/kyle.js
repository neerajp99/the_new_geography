    questions: [
        `Kyle, so you've had a
background in philosophy and computer science, right? Exactly. What popped out while
researching about you on Google. Where did that come from? Essentially? It's sobriety
combination.`,

`What would you define Art and creativity as to be blunt?`,

    answers: [
`Yeah. It's  I mean, basically I. I went to university,
thinking that I liked working with computers.  and as I got deeper into computer science,
I realized that my interests were much more,  a theorial kind of philosophical and,
not necessarily, I didn't want to do some kind of,  Theoretical computer science work.
I didn't want to go into, you could have a standard programming job.  I found
myself drawn much more to the arts and kind of deeper questions about
computers.  The thing that drew me to compete. One of the things that drew me to
computers in the first place chatbots I was, you know, in IRC channels and, , late nineties,
early two thousands,  and was really amazed by chatbots like mega how and some other
kind of really simple template based,  , and, , that may be, you may wonder, like,
you know, how far can this go?
How, how far can we push,  the appearance of intelligence and. I started to
seeing the university that this kind of combination between philosophical questions and see
us questions was more for me. But then as I got deeper into kind of AI, like philosophy and
computer science, I,  found out that most of the people working on AI were still doing
very practical things with it.
They were.  you know, trying to scan the digits when you,  ,
put your check in the caching or in the ATM, you know, they were trying to, , They were
trying to predict the movement of the stock market. They were trying to predict housing
prices, things like that.  very practical, like economic things, which was not interesting to
me at all.And, , that led me more towards, in this arts direction. And I started to think.
You know, in a kind of artful way,  in the context of music and the context of visual art,
 I started to get more interested kind of separately in generative art, which was sort of
along.  long interest from me, but sort of parallel. So even in high school, I was thinking about using computers to make weird
abstract visuals, but I didn't know there was a name for it.  I was writing, you know, cute
basic programs to,  generate like constellations. I started doing more interactive work,  interactive installations using
computer vision.  and then over the last, let's say five years or so.  it's kind of come
back to the AI again, because machine learning has completely changed when I was in
university. I was really interested in neural networks, but no one else was interested in it. It was like, you know, 2005, 2006, I was trying to build neural networks to make
weird sounds. And,  the research group, the AI research group I was working in at the
time, my advisor told me. That was like a dead end that neural networks were never going to
go anywhere. And that I should forget about them and work on the real stuff, which was a
symbolic and logic based programming. `,



`I don't really have a
singular for art. I don't have a singular definition. Bbut I do think of art a lot of the time because I do so many different things. I
tend to think of art,  in contrasts. So,  you know, I think of art in contrast to design, I
think of art in contrast to science. And I think about what the differences are in each of
those cases.  you know, how do I feel and think differently when I'm. Working on an art project versus something that's kind of scientific or engineering
project. For me, I, I think of,  I think of, art, for example, design art
is general, sorry. Design is generally about kind of solving a problem. And sometimes that
involves some craft. Art tends to be about creating problems and kind of maybe
even just exploring problems without necessarily finding solutions. in the science, it's just nice in the discovery, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah.
Absolutely. Art can be a lot more process-based where, something like design or science
can be kind of outcome based.  these kinds of differences are what are important to
me. I don't really think of art as a, you know, art is this, and I'm trying to do that thing. It's more like it's a lot of different things and each of these things do delineate it
from other disciplines. Let me just pull this up for a second.
sure. One second. I had some thought on this just yesterday and I was thinking, I need to
clarify this more and now you're asking me, yeah. I don't see it too many notes. Yeah, I think designers, designers solve problems.
Artists create problems. I think with science, science can be a lot more about, kind
of like doing things that are. Based on the evidence and clear like making decisions
that are based on experiments and trying to like test hypothesis. I think that art involved some of those things sometimes, but it's not primarily
about any kind of,  you know, you're, you're not contributing to some,  you
know, like. Perfect objective, understanding of the world with art. You're making something
that can be interpreted in a much more subjective way, and maybe it builds people up in the
same way science does, but it builds people up in a maybe more personal subjective way. I think, uh, art and technology can be like technology and engineering as
fields can be very different from each other because, You know, a startup, for example,
it was designed to usually to like reinforce the status quo somehow, and it's designed
to, uh, you know, work in the context of capitalism. Art is designed to work outside the context of capitalism it's designed
to operate in a kind of give the economy where. You're not creating something of value that,
uh, can be sort of traded monetarily or like produce money for anybody. It's something of
value that creates sort of a kind of Something of deeper value. There's of course, interaction between kind of monitoring and get the
economies. But,I see that as being a big difference. So when I'm working with like a
startup, uh, on, uh, or a tech company on a project,these kinds of differences become
really stark. You know, my goal for working on a project with a company like Google is going
to be very different than Google's goal, right.`
