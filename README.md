## AI Generative Art and Perspectives 
AIDAD - Is AI, The 21st Century DADA Movement?
``` A Technical, Sociological, Economics and Philosophical Overview. ```

## Aspects covered

``` Technical Aspects ```
The science, technology, geometry and background to Artificial Intelligence and Art. The study aims to reflect upon the works of generative design, generative algorithm, Julia sets, Mandelbrot sets and a lot more. In addition, we explore various definitions of creativity.

``` Philisophy ```
This study involves an analysis and evaluation of how philosophers would perceive AI Art and whether the AI art movement mirrors the early 1900s Dada Movement. In addition, an analysis of the industrial revolution and Futurist art leads us to the reasoning of how AI art might have originated in the first place.

``` Economics ```
A study of the market and Art collectors along with a behaviour analysis of how people perceive art. And a comparative market study between AI art and Non-Art markets. In addition, the impacts on the Job market and the short run/long run consequences of AI in the Art world have been made. And the question of AI art being the next big Ghost work has been evaluated.

``` Sociology ```
A study of democratization of art and how AI art could make art more accessible to various sectors of society.

``` Interviews and Surveys ```
Interviews with several AI and non-AI artists from across the field of Art and Design have been conducted from the month from July to August to evaluate the market, reflect upon technology behind AI and what they feel about their work. In addition, surveys across the University community were conducted to ascertain certain psychological perceptions.
